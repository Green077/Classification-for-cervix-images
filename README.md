# Classification-for-cervix-images
It's a competition in kaggle. Dataset could be fetched at https://www.kaggle.com/cpruce/cervix-image-segmentation/data 

In this competition, you will develop algorithms to correctly classify cervix types based on cervical images.  These different types of cervix in the data set are all considered normal (not cancerous). Identifying the transformation zones is not an easy task for the healthcare providers, therefore, an algorithm-aided decision will significantly improve the quality and efficiency of cervical cancer screening for these patients.  The goal is to do a classification for three types transformation zones and try to predict the type for each transformation zone according to the image. The dataset is really large, almost around 80G, so I build a server in Google Cloud platform to handle this. Read the images by cv2 library, and split the data into two parts, train set and test set. Extract the gradient features of images by watershed algorithm and Stochastic gradient descent. Create VGG model to train the data, the final prediction accuracy reaches 60%.
